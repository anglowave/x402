```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for deployment"

## Step 4: Add Environment Variables

Go to the service dashboard and add these environment variables:

```

### Free Tier Limitations
- Services spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after spin-down takes ~30 seconds (cold start)
- 750 hours/month free

### Vault Funding
Make sure your vault has:
- SOL for transaction fees (~0.1 SOL)
- USDC for demo payments (~50 USDC)

Fund at: https://solscan.io/account/Ctty13EdquEQSMUyrxBdfZnVkzAF9sgHQwdUdjUKwhBP

### Monitoring
